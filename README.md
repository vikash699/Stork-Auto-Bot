- Displays validation statistics and user information
- Configurable validation interval
- Support for proxy servers to distribute requests
- Multi-threaded processing for improved performance

## Requirements

- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- Valid Stork Oracle account

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/airdropinsiders/Stork-Auto-Bot.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Stork-Auto-Bot
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Configure your credentials (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

### Easy Setup with config.json

The bot now uses a config.json file for configuration. When you run the bot for the first time, it will create a default config.json file that you can edit.

1. Run the bot once to generate the default config file:
```
node index.js
```

2. Edit the generated `config.json` file with your credentials:
```json
{
  "cognito": {
    "region": "ap-northeast-1",
    "clientId": "5msns4n49hmg3dftp2tp1t2iuh",
    "userPoolId": "ap-northeast-1_M22I44OpC",
    "username": "your-email@example.com",
    "password": "your-password"
  },
  "stork": {
    "intervalSeconds": 5
  },
  "threads": {
    "maxWorkers": 1
  }
}
```

3. Replace `username` and `password` with your Stork Oracle account credentials

### Optional: Proxy Configuration

To use proxy servers for distribution of requests:

1. Create a `proxies.txt` file in the project root
2. Add one proxy per line in any of these formats:
   - HTTP proxies: `http://user:pass@host:port`
   - SOCKS proxies: `socks5://user:pass@host:port`

## Usage

Start the bot with:
```
node stork-bot.js
```

The bot will:
1. Authenticate using your credentials from config.json
2. Fetch signed price data at regular intervals
3. Validate each data point
4. Submit validation results to Stork Oracle
5. Display your current statistics

## Advanced Configuration Options

In your `config.json` file, you can adjust:

- `stork.intervalSeconds`: How often the validation process runs in seconds (default: 5)
- `threads.maxWorkers`: Number of concurrent validation workers (default: 1)

## Troubleshooting

- If you see authentication errors, check that your username and password in config.json are correct
- If the bot fails to start, ensure your config.json file is properly formatted JSON
- If you see token-related errors after successful authentication, the tokens.json file may be corrupted - delete it and let the bot regenerate it
- For connection issues, check your internet connection and verify the Stork Oracle API is accessible
- If using proxies, check that your proxies.txt is properly formatted and proxies are operational
